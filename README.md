### Hi I'm Xiangpeng (Elric) 👋
I currently work as a Research Scientist at ProtagoLabs Inc..

<!-- ### Project
- 🔭 Content-based analysis for traditional media with NLP
●	Proposed an NLP-based information retrieval approach for social media using twitter API, BERT classification, and BERT question-answering models that collect real-time traffic data as a complementary source for official reports.
- 🔭 Extract and Convert Social Media Text into Valuable Real-time Traffic Data
●	Analyzed the reporting bullets and bias for traditional media using BART summarization model and Louvain clustering methods with large numbers of articles collected from various sources.
- 🔭 Incremental Recommendation System for Large-scale Regular and Ride-hailing Taxi Services
●	Designed a smart recommendation system for human-driven and autonomous ride-hailing taxis by predicting the future potential customers using ARIMA and LSTM models. Reduce the average customer waiting time by 37%
- 🔭 Urban Route Planning for Vehicles and Drones
●	Developed an optimized route planning algorithm for both vehicles and drones using Mix Integer Linear programming and Dijkstra's algorithm. Saving average 16% travel time. -->
